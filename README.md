- __Possible additional modules to install (if module not found)__
  npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
	npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts
  npm install react-router-dom@6

- __Where can I find more resources?__
  This Box is a sweet combo of [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). Either one would be a great place to start!
